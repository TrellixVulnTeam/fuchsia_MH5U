  #
  # * Using escaped double quotes around $@ causes all of the arguments to be
  #   concatenated into a single space-separated string.
  # * Using escaped double quotes isn't safe if any item in the array contains a
  #   double quotation mark.
  # * Using printf allows all strings to be safely included in the array.
  # * Using printf prevents variable expansion when the status file is sourced as
  #   a script.

# Returns the latest name for the mock file given.
# The Bash test framework creates a file named <mock_state> (by default
# <tool>.mock_state) for the first execution of the mock. For a second
# execution, it renames the first file to <mock_state>.1 and creates a
# <mock_state>.2. After that, each subsequent execution of the mock creates
# a file named <mock_state>.<n>. For most tests, it is relevant to check
# the n-th specific execution, but in some rare cases, for example when the
# mock is executed in a loop, the test can care only about the latest execution
# and finding it is a tedious process. This method helps with that, returning
# <mock_state> if there was none or only a single invocation of the mock, or
# <mock_state>.<n> if there were <n> executions of the mock.
#
# Args:
#   name: the mock state filename without the ".<n>" suffix.
