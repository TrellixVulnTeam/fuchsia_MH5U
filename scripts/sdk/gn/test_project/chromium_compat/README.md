# Chromium compatibility tests

These build files are analogs to Chromium's //build/config/fuchsia templates and should
be kept up to date while Chromium adopts the GN SDK templates. The goal is to maintain
backwards compatibility at all times so changes to these rules do not break their build.

Once the transition is complete, these files will no longer be needed.
