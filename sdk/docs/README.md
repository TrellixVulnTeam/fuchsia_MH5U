# Integrator Development Kit (IDK) documentation

The present directory contains documentation that is included in the IDK.
As such, its contents should be self-sufficient and consumable outside of the
context of the Fuchsia source repository.

## Guidelines

* this documentation does not aim to provide a Fuchsia 101 but to document
  the contents of the SDK;
* if some light Fuchsia 101 is needed, expose it as a short background blob
  in your document;
* do not not rely on documentation that exists in other parts of the source
  repository;
* aim for conciseness.
