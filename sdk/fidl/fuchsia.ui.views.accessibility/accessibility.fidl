/// A protocol for registering a 'fuchsia.ui.views.Focuser' to be used by an
/// accessibility service.
///
/// Accessibility services can drastically alter the way an user interacts with
/// a system. For example, instead of changing the focus from one view to
/// another using the touch screen, this user may use voice. For this reason,
/// accessibility services need a way to be able to request focus to whatever
/// view on the system, as this request can come in any form of input, not
/// necessarily the one that normally drives focus in a particular device.
///
/// The request from the accessibility service assumes that whoever implements
/// this protocol associates this request with a view that sits high in the view
/// hierarchy.
