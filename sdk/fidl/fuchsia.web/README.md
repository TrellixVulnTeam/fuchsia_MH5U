# Fuchsia Web Protocol

## Bugs and Feature Requests
For issues related to these FIDL protocols, use the
[WebSupport component](https://bugs.fuchsia.dev/p/fuchsia/issues/entry?components=WebSupport).

For issues with specific implementations, use the implementation's
bug tracker. For example, for issues specific to the Chromium WebEngine
implementation, follow [this guidance](../../../src/chromium/README.md#bugs-and-feature-requests).

## Making Changes
When making changes to the required protocols, also update manifest shards as
appropriate.

For the Chromium implementation, these are located in
[`//src/chromium/web_engine/meta/shards/`](../../../src/chromium/web_engine/meta/shards/).
