# `fuchsia.element` CTS test

This is a compatibility test for `fuchsia.element` FIDL APIs.

## Motivation

The [Session Framework][doc-sfw-intro] provides tools and APIs to create product
experiences on Fuchsia that combine software from the platform (e.g.
`session_manager`), product (the [session][glossary-session]), and third-parties
([elements][glossary-element]).  Interoperability between components is
a challenge because they may implement the framework’s contracts differently or
rely on undocumented behaviors.

The Fuchsia [Compatibility Test Suite][doc-cts-rfc] (CTS) is a collection of
tests that ensure a Fuchsia product build is backwards-compatible with software
written against previous versions of the platform.

Session compatibility tests are a subset of the CTS that exercise contracts
between:

1. **Platform and session**: ensuring platform changes do not break existing
   sessions, including changes to platform-provided session components (e.g.
   input pipeline, `element_manager`)
2. **Session and elements**: ensuring sessions are compatible with common types
   of elements — for example, that a Flutter app is launched and presented
   similarly on different products.

## Component Topology

Session CTS tests are CFv2 components that launch a Session Framework and the
session under test in an isolated environment.

The tests start a reference session that is composed from platform-provided
components. It is intended for testing the Session CTS itself (all tests should
pass with the reference session), and for integration testing the
platform-provided components.

## Reference session

Tests that exercise launching elements may use a reference element provided by
the CTS.

The test suite ships with a reference session implementation that passes all
tests. It is a minimal session that contains just enough to exercise the tests,
and is not intended to be a fully-fledged example of a product.

The reference session is not tailored specifically for the test environment.
Neither the tests nor the reference session know about each other’s existence,
as to avoid coupling tests to a particular session implementation.

The reference session reuses platform-provided components as much as possible.
This encourages code reuse between products and frees developers from worrying
about implementing boilerplate functionality (e.g. launching element
components). This code needs to be packaged as a component, not a library,
because the CTS may only depend on SDK atoms.

## Tests

### `element_manager_test`: Proposing an element is successful

The simplest possible test for the
[fuchsia.element.Manager][source-element-manager-fidl] protocol proposes an
element and asserts that the result was successful.

## Example usage

```
$ fx set core.x64 --with-base "//sdk/cts"
$ fx test fuchsia-element-tests -o
```
