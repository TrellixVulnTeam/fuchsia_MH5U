# Util

This directory contains binaries and utilities that are needed to run individual
end-to-end CTS tests -- e.g. host programs that communicate with the device
during a given test.

Note: the //sdk/cts/tools directory is the best location for tools that operate
on the overall CTS. This directory should be used to hold test-specific
companion binaries.
