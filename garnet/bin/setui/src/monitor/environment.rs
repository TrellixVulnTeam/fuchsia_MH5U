//! Defining and handling of the monitor environment.
//!
//! # Summary
//!
//! The monitoring logic in the setting service is meant to be modular. Based on
//! product configuration, a variety of sources (resource monitors) and
//! sinks (data outlets) may participate in the monitoring environment. The
//! components in this mod are meant to aid capturing and passing this setup
//! to the appropriate handling component, and bringing up the environment as
//! directed. The separation of this responsibility from the main
//! resource-watching component promotes code reshare and modularity.
