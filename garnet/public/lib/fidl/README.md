FIDL: Fuchsia Interface Description Language
============================================


[FIDL](../../../../docs/development/languages/fidl/README.md) is an interface
definition language and encoding format used to describe *protocols* to be used
on Fuchsia.

FIDL includes libraries and tools for generating bindings from `.fidl` for
supported languages. Currently, the supported languages include C, C++, Dart,
Go, and Rust.


## IDE support

The [`language-fidl` plugin][language-fidl] provides syntax highlighting for
FIDL files in [Atom][atom].
