# What is Garnet?

Garnet was formerly a layer of Fuchsia. The concept dates back to a previous
design of Fuchsia's build and runtime known as the "Fuchsia layer cake". This
design was deprecated in 2019 in favor of consolidating all of Fuchsia's open
source code in a single repository (aka "fuchsia.git"). The `//garnet` directory
is a leftover relic of that change.

Please don't add things to this directory.
You are encouraged to remove things from this directory.
