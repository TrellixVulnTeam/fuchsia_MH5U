# Component URLs {#component-urls}

A component URL is a [URL][wiki-url] that locates a component, including its
declaration, program, and assets. Component URLs are resolved to
[component declarations][doc-manifests-declaration] by a
[resolver][doc-resolvers].

## Usage

The primary use of component URLs is to identify a component in the definition
of a component instance, as part of a
[child declaration][doc-manifests-children].

You should not use component URLs to identify component *instances*, as multiple
component instances can share the same URL. For that purpose, instead use
[monikers][doc-monikers].

## Format

A component URL can, in principle, have any [scheme][rfc-uri-scheme]. Some
common schemes you may encounter are:

-   [fuchsia-pkg](#fuchsia-pkg)
-   [fuchsia-boot](#fuchsia-boot)
-   [http(s)](#http)

### fuchsia-pkg {#fuchsia-pkg}

A `fuchsia-pkg` component URL is a [package URL][doc-package-url] that locates a
component distributed in a [Fuchsia package][doc-package].

It has the same format as [package URL][doc-package-url], with a
[resource path][doc-package-url-resource-path] relative to the package root that
locates a [component manifest][doc-manifests]. This path is usually of the form
`meta/<manifest_name>.cm`.

```
fuchsia-pkg://<repo-hostname>[/<pkg-name>[/<pkg-variant>][?hash=<pkg-hash>][#<path-to-manifest>]]
```

Example:

```
fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/stash#meta/stash_secure.cm
```

### fuchsia-boot {#fuchsia-boot}

A `fuchsia-boot` component URL locates a component in the system boot image.
This scheme is used to identify components that must be resolved during early
boot before a [`fuchsia-pkg`](#fuchsia-pkg) [resolver][doc-resolvers] is
available. It has the following format:

```
fuchsia-boot:///<path-to-manifest-in-bootfs>
```

Example:

```
fuchsia-boot:///#meta/driver_manager.cm
```

### http(s) {#http}

An `http(s)` component URL identifies a web page as a component. Such a
component could be executed as a web page in a web [runner][doc-runners], for
example.

Example:

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippos
```

## Relative URLs

The Component Framework supports a subset of relative URLs (Relative URLs are
defined in [URL RFC 3986][url-rfc-3986]). Specifically, Component Framework
only supports relative URLs that are URL fragments.
If a relative URL has any fields set other than the fragment then it will
not resolve.


A relative URL is resolved at runtime based on the URL of the parent
component's [package][package].
This allows component reuse between packages without creating additional manifests.

Relative URLs have the following format:

```
#<path-to-manifest>
```

Example:

```
#meta/child.cm
```

For a `fuchsia-pkg` parent component with the following URL:

```
fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/package#meta/component.cm
```

The relative URL resolves to:


```
fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/package#meta/child.cm
```

### When should I use a relative URL?

Developers should use relative URLs when identifying other components in
the same [package][package] as the parent component.

This pattern is often used in tests, where the best practice is to re-package
production components in a test-specific package.
