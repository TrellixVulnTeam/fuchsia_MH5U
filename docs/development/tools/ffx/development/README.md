# Developing for FFX

This section provides resources for building plugins to integrate with `ffx`
developer tools.

## Get started with plugins

To get started building a simple plugin for `ffx`, see
[developing an ffx plugin](plugins.md)

## Experimental plugins

If this is the start of a larger project, introduce the new plugin by marking it
experimental. This will allow for work-in-progress commits and allow others to
try out your plugin by opting-in. For more details, see
[experimental plugins](plugin-experimental.md).

## Advanced plugin development

For a more detailed look into the internals of the `ffx` plugin architecture,
see [plugin internals](plugin-internals.md).
