# Third-party Dart packages

There are two types of third-party dependencies in the Fuchsia tree:

- Extracted from [pub][pub].
- Synced from Git.

## Pub dependencies

Pub dependencies are hosted at [`//third-party/dart-pkg`][dart-3p]. That project
is regularly kept up-to-date with [a script][dart-3p-script] that relies on the
`pub` tool to resolve versions and fetch sources for the packages that are used
in the tree.
This script uses a set of canonical local packages, which are assumed to be
providing the necessary package coverage for the entire tree.

Additionally, projects may request third-party dependencies to be imported
through the following procedure:

1. Locate the `dart_dependencies.yaml` file in //src/dart.
2. In `dart_dependencies.yaml`, append the desired dependencies to 'dependencies':

   ```
   name: module
   dependencies:
     foo: ^4.0.0
     bar: >=0.1.0
   ```

3. Run this script:

   ```
   //scripts/dart/update_3p_packages.py
   ```

4. Merge your changes to `dart_dependencies.yaml` to main.
5. Merge the files, downloaded by running the `update_3p_packages.py` script, to main.
6. In the `//integration/fuchsia/third_party/dart` manifest, update the project node `third_part/dart-pkg` revision attribute with the SHA from your commit of `dart_dependencies.yaml`..
7. Merge your change to the `//integration/fuchsia/third_party/dart` manifest file to main.
