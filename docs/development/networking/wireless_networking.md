# Fuchsia Wireless Networking

Fuchsia's wireless networking stack intends to provide a compliant non-AP station
implementation of IEEE Std 802.11. It supports hardware with both "full MAC" and
"soft MAC" firmware, in which the MLME layer of the 802.11 spec is implemented
in the firmware and the host OS, respectively.

Further documentation can be found in the [READMEs for WLAN components](/src/connectivity/wlan/README.md).
