//! This test component has two modes:
//!
//! 1. Default: just runs and hangs serving its out directory. This is used to test a component
//!    that doesn't expose a out/diagnostics directory.
//!
//! 2. "with-diagnostics": this mode serves an inspect tree that just contains information about
//!    the component being healthy. Serving the inspect Tree creates a `diagnostics` directory.
//!     This is used for testing a component that exposes an out/diagnostics directory.
