# Package Resolver Integration Test TUF Template

This directory is a snapshot of initial TUF metadata, in order to speed up the
package resolver integration tests. The metadata is generated by the
`generate-metadata.go` helper script, which creates an empty TUF repository.

## Regenerating Metadata

Metadata can be regenerated by running:

```
% go run regenerate-metadata.go
```

It will replace the metadata in the `repository` directory with the latest
version produced by go-tuf.
