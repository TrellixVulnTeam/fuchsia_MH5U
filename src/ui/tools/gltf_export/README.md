# Scenic Snapshot Tool

This directory contains gltf_export, a simple tool for capturing a snapshot
of the composition being rendered. Snapshots are saved to the human-readable
glTF scene file format, and can then be uploaded into a glTF viewer to be
visualized in 3D.

## USAGE

    (host) $ fx shell gltf_export > [FILE NAME].gltf
