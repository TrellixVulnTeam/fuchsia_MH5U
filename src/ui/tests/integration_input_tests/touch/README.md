## Build the test

```shell
$ fx set <product>.<arch> --with //src/ui/tests/integration_input_tests/touch:tests
```

## Run the test

Remember to kill a running Scenic before starting the test. (If the zircon
console is running, you don't need to do this.)

```shell
$ fx shell killall scenic.cmx
```

To run the fully-automated test, use this fx invocation:

```shell
$ fx test touch-input-test
```

To see extra logs:

```shell
$ fx test --min-severity-logs=DEBUG touch-input-test -- --verbose=2
```

## Run the perf test

In order to report metrics into the performance dashboards, this test is
run as part of a performance test. The performance test uses the E2E
testing framework (to post-process the metrics data).

You can run the performance test manually as follows:

```shell
$ fx set <product>.<arch> --with //src/tests/end_to_end/perf:touch_input_test
$ fx build
$ fx run-e2e-tests touch_input_latency_benchmarks_test
```

## Performance tracking

This test suite uses the
[Fuchsia tracing system](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/tracing) to
collect metrics.

TODO(fxbug.dev/50245): Add description about how trace metrics are tracked in CQ.

### Add trace metrics to the test

This test suite uses the category `touch-input-test` to log trace events. Any
new categories added to a test will need to be included in the `fx traceutil
record` command below.

Trace event types can be found in
[`libtrace`](//zircon/system/ulib/trace/include/lib/trace/event.h).

### Record a trace of the test

Add the tracing package to your `fx set`:

```shell
$ fx set <product>.<arch> --with //src/ui/tests/integration_input_tests/touch:tests --with-base=//garnet/packages/prod:tracing
```

To record a trace of the test, use this fx invocation:

```shell
$ fx traceutil record --duration 20s --categories touch-input-test fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/touch-input-test#meta/touch-input-test.cmx
```

Note: The default duration for `traceutil record` is 10 seconds. When running
locally, package resolving can take more than 10 seconds. If the recording ends
before the test completes, increase the amount of time in the `--duration` flag.

## Play with the flutter client

To play around with the flutter client used in the automated test, invoke the
client like this:

```shell
$ fx shell present_view fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/one-flutter#meta/one-flutter.cmx
```

## Play with the C++ GFX client

To play around with the C++ GFX client used in the automated test, invoke the
client like this:

```shell
$ fx shell present_view fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/cpp-gfx-client#meta/cpp-gfx-client.cmx
```

## Play with the web client

To play around with the web client used in the automated test, invoke the
client like this:

```shell
$ fx shell present_view fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/one-chromium#meta/one-chromium.cmx
```
