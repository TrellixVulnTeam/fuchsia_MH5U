// This wrapper of an InStream adds the ability to peek into the stream.
//
// As with InStream, this class has blocking methods, and completion of those
// methods relies on the FIDL thread being a separate thread.

 public:
  // in_stream_to_wrap - the underlying source of data, typically not capable
  //     of peeking, to wrap such that peeking is possible.
  // max_peek_bytes - the maximum peek distance in bytes.  Some usages will need
  //     a peek distance that's as large as an AU, such as when searching for
  //     pattern-based start codes.  Others may not need much peek distance at
  //     all, such as when headers at the start of each AU indicate the length
  //     of the AU.
  //
  // This InStreamPeeker takes ownership of in_stream_to_wrap and does not
  // provide any direct access to in_stream_to_wrap, since the read-ahead
  // performed by this instance would only confuse any direct use of
  // in_stream_to_wrap.
  //
  // The in_stream_to_wrap is only called during ReadBytes() or PeekBytes(),
  // using the same thread as those calls are made on.
  //
  // The first three parameters to this constructor are for consistency in
  // threading across all InStream types.  We want the InStream base class to
  // be able to assert that methods are being called on the correct thread, etc.
