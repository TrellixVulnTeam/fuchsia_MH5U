# Audio Effects Example Tests

This directory contains the sources for a test binary that validates an audio effect loadable
module implementation.  Just as the parent directory contains sources from which a vendor can build
their own audio effects module implementation, similarly this directory contains a suggested
starting point for the tests that vendors should create to verify correct operation of their
library.
