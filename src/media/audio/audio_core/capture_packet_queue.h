// This queue has two states:
//
// Initially, a packet is pushed onto a "pending" queue. The mixer will write to the first
// packet in the pending queue, and once the mixer is done, it will move that packet to the
// "ready" queue, meaning the packet is now ready to be sent to the client. The FIDL loop
// will pop packets from the ready queue as they become available.
//
// Packets are pushed onto the pending queue in one of two ways:
//
//   1. For preallocated queues, the pending queue is prepopulated automatically. After
//      a packet is popped from the ready queue, it can be added back to the pending queue
//      by Recycle().
//
//   2. For dynamically allocated queues, packets must be explicitly pushed onto the
//      pending queue, and once the packet is popped from the ready queue, the caller
//      takes permanent ownership.
//
// This class is thread safe.
