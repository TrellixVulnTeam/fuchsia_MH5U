// measurements are eventually displayed in an overall recap, after all other tests have completed.
//
// We perform frequency tests at various frequencies (kSummaryFreqs[] from frequency_set.h), storing
// the result for each frequency.
//
// Although these audio measurements are quantitative, there is no 'right answer' per se. Rather, we
// compare current measurements to those previously measured, to detect any fidelity regressions.
// Because the code being tested is largely mathematical (only dependencies being a few FBL
// functions), we will fail on ANY regression, since presumably an intentional change in our
// fidelity would contain in that same CL a change to these thresholds.
//
// All reference values and measured values are in decibels (+20dB => 10x magn). When comparing
// values to the below limits, a specified 'tolerance' refers to the maximum delta (positive OR
// negative) from reference value. For ALL OTHER limits (Noise Floor, FrequencyResponse,
// SignalToNoiseAndDistortion), values being assessed should be **greater than or equal to** the
// specified limit.
//
// We save previous results to 8-digit accuracy (>23 bits), exceeding float32 precision. This does
// not pose a risk of 'flaky test' since the math should be the same every time. With no real
// dependencies outside FBL, we expect any change that affects these results to be directly within
// the core objects (Mixer, Gain, OutputProducer), and the corresponding adjustments to these
// thresholds should be included with that CL.
