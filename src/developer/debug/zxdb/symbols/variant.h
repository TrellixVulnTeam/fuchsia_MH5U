  // DWARF discriminant values can be either signed or unsigned, according to the type associated
  // with the discriminant data member in the VariantPart.  This makes it complicated do handle
  // because the full type of the VariantPart needs to be understood just to properly parse the
  // Variant out of the file.
  //
  // Since our only current use of these is Rust which always uses unsigned discriminants, we also
  // assume unsigned here.
  //
  // If in the future we need to support signed discriminants, we could sign-extend the values
  // during decode so that internally we always deal with unsigned types.

  //
  //   enum MyEnum {
  //     Foo,
  //     Bar(i32),
  //   }
  //
  // DWARF will define two structure types "MyEnum::Foo" (with no members) and "MyEnum::Bar" (with
  // one member) and each variant's data members will contain a DataMember of that type. The "name"
  // of these data members will match the type ("Foo" and "Bar" in this example).
