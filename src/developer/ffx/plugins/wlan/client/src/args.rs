// RemoveNetwork and SaveNetwork both require a NetworkConfig.  There currently is no clean way to
// share that struct argument between them in argh though.  Some failed experiments:
// (1) If the shared struct is passed directly to the top-level argument enum, then both
//     SaveNetwork and RemoveNetwork will have the same command name which is not desirable.
// (2) argh does not support tuple structs so these commands cannot simply inherit a struct's
//     fields.
// (3) Nesting the network config as a subcommand requires the manual implementation of FromStr
//     which for a command that requires this number of flags would be cumbersome.
//
// The main feature that needs to be shared between these structs is the ability to quickly convert
// them into WLAN policy structs.  While it is possible to create a macro to do all of this code
// generation, the macro ends up requiring several dependencies which makes including the shared
// definitions in other modules a confusing battle against the compiler until the dependencies are
// all found.
//
// Until a better solution exists, the arguments module provides a helper to enable construction of
// a NetworkConfig from the argument struct fields.
