# FFX

Future Fuchsia experience (FFX) provides a service oriented interface to many
common development and integration workflow operations that users may wish to
perform against one or more Fuchsia target devices.

It is both a service runtime, and a collection of utilities, and it is
intended for both users and infrastructure integrators alike.

## Getting Started
