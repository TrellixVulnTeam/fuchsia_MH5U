# Test Keys for assembly testing

This library holds some (otherwise unused) key-pairs that can be used for writing
unit- and integration-tests for the assembly process:

- [VBMeta library](../vbmeta/README.md)
- [FFX Assembly Plugin](/src/developer/ffx/plugins/assembly/README.md)

These are test-only keys.
