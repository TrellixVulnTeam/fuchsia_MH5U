# LLVM `profdata` format support library

This library provides support for the `llvm-profdata` file format in a program
compiled using Clang's SourceBasedCoverage or LLVM profiling instrumentation.
This is a substitute for the standard runtime included in the `compiler-rt`
suite.  It's meant for low-level environments like kernels and boot loaders
where toolchain-supplied runtime libraries are not available.  It does not
implement any I/O or data transport itself, but only a simple API for getting a
dump in `llvm-profdata` format into a memory buffer and for interacting with
the code instrumentation generated by the compiler.
