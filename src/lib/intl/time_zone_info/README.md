# Time Zone Info Service library

This is the underlying implementation behind the Time Zone Info Service (see
[`//src/intl/time_zone_info_service/`](../../../intl/time_zone_info_service/).

The library is kept as a separate target to allow it to be integrated into
different host components as needed.
