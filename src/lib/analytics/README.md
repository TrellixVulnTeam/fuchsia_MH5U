# Analytics library

This is an analytics library that can be used by other tools to log metrics or
user behavioral data into Google Analytics, Taqo, etc.

For example, it will provide Google Analytics wrapper for many DX tools such as
zxdb and fidlcat. It will also enable user experience research data collection
in those tools.
