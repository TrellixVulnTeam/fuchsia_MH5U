// |fasync::scope|
//
// Provides a mechanism for binding futures to the lifetime of another object such that they are
// destroyed before that object goes out of scope. It is particularly useful for ensuring that the
// lifetime of a future does not exceed the lifetime of any variables that it has captured by
// reference.
//
// A scope is thread-safe but non-reentrant: it must not be destroyed while any of its associated
// futures are running.
//
// EXAMPLE
//
// Define a |fasync::scope| as a member of the object to whose lifetime the futures should be bound.
//
//     // We mark this class final because its destructor has side-effects that rely on the order of
//     // destruction. If this object were subclassed there would be a possibility for futures bound
//     // to its scope to inadvertently access the subclass's state while the object was being
//     // destroyed.

//     private:
//         int prior_total_ = 0;
//
//         // This member is last so that the scope is exited before all other members of the object
//         // are destroyed. Alternately, we could enforce this ordering by explicitly invoking
//         // |fasync::scope::exit()| where appropriate.
//         fasync::scope scope_;
