//! This test crate demonstrates that `fuchsia_inspect_derive` can be used
//! standalone, without depending on `fuchsia_inspect`. This is
//! important since the procedural macros must output code that uses types that
//! must be locally available in the namespace of the user code. Concretely,
//! this would occur if the user depends on crate which re-exports
//! `fuchsia_inspect` types, instead of depending on `fuchsia_inspect`
//! directly.
