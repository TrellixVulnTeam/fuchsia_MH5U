`sktool` is a basic tool to scan a Fuchsia system for FIDO security keys
and perform simple operations on those security keys. Please refer to
src/main.rs for command line options.

The tool is intended to aid development of security support on Fuchsia and it
will potentially be deleted once this support is complete.
