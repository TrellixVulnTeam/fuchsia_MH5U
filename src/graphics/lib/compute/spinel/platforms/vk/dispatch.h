//
// BACKGROUND:
//
//   Spinel paths and rasters can be long-lived.  A path or raster can
//   be created once and never disposed for the life of the Spinel
//   context.
//
//   Paths and rasters are defined through the public Spinel builder
//   APIs and are represented by opaque 32-bit handles.
//
//   A returned path or raster handle can immediately be used in
//   downstream dependent sub-APIs long before the path or raster is
//   actually materialized on the GPU.
//
//   This period where a path or raster hasn't been fully materialized
//   on the GPU but is referenced by a dependent sub-pipeline requires
//   that the handle's state be tracked so that happens-before
//   relationships are enforced.
//
// TIMELINE:
//
//   A Spinel "timeline" enforces happens-before relationships between
//   the path creation, raster creation and composition sub-pipelines.
//
//   The Spinel pipeline has two different sub-pipeline dependencies:
//
//     - PATHS-TO-RASTERS: Paths defined by the path builder have to
//       migrated to the GPU and packaged in a GPU-optimal coalesced
//       format before rasterization can begin.
//
//       The raster builder can immediately define rasterization
//       commands using path handles for unmaterialized paths.
//
//       But before the rasterization sub-pipeline can start, all path
//       dependencies must be resolved -- which may include flushing
//       path builders -- and the paths materialized.
//
//       Observe that there can be a one-to-many dependency between a
//       single path builder and more than one raster builders.
//
//     - RASTERS-TO-COMPOSITIONS: Rasters defined by the raster
//       builder are paths that have to be rasterized and
//       post-processed before placement into a composition.
//
//       A composition can immediately define place commands that
//       using raster handles for unmaterialized rasters.
//
//       But before the composition sub-pipeline can start, all raster
//       dependencies must be resolved -- which may include flushing
//       raster builders -- and the rasters materialized.
//
//       Observe that there can be a one-to-many dependency between a
//       single raster builder and more than one composition.
//
// CONSTRAINTS:
//
//   - One-to-many signalling isn't possible with VkSemaphores.
//
//   - Both VkSemapores and VkEvents must record a signal before
//     recording a wait.
//
//   - Allocating a Vulkan synchronization type per handle isn't
//     feasible.
//
//   - We would *prefer* to have as many driver-schedulable compute
//     shaders in flight as possible rather than have the host
//     explicitly manage the flow graph of dependencies because it
//     will add significant inter-submission latencies to the
//     pipeline. Note that this remains an option and was implemented
//     by earlier non-Vulkan implementations.
//
//   - Until Timeline Semaphores are available, the host will need to
//     explicitly schedule the task graph.
//
// OPERATION:
//
//   A "signaller" is:
//
//     - A path builder that defines a group of paths that are
//       dispatched to the GPU for processing. When the paths have
//       been materialized the dispatched group signals completion.
//
//     - A raster builder that defines a group of rasters that are
//       constructed from paths defined by a path builder and
//       dispatched to the GPU for processing.  When the rasters have
//       been materialized the dispatched group signals completion.
//
//  A "waiter" is:
//
//     - A raster builder that is waiting on one or more dispatched
//       groups of paths to materialize.
//
//     - A composition that is waiting on one or more dispatched
//       groups of rasters to materialize.
//
//  SIGNALLER:
//
//    1. A signaller works on a quantum of work called a "dispatch".
//
//    2. When a new dispatch is started, a dispatch id is acquired.
//
//    3. When the dispatch is complete, any registered handles are
//       marked complete and all waiters are signalled.
//
//  WAITER:
//
//    1. Before the waiter's dispatch is submitted, the waiter forces
//       all dependencies to be submitted.
//
//    2. The dependencies are determined by looking up each handle's
//       dispatch id in a table internal to the dispatch.
//
//    3. Each handle dispatch's signal list is updated with the waiter's
//       dispatch id.
//
//    4. When the waiter's dispatch is submitted, if the waiter's count
//       of signallers is zero then the dispatch is immediately
//       submitted to Vulkan.
//
//    5. If the waiter's count of signallers is greater than zero then
//       the dispatch is added to a wait list and won't be submitted to
//       Vulkan until signallers drive the wait count to zero.
