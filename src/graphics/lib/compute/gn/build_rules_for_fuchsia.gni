# Technical note:
#
# It might be useful to clarify what Fuchsia packages and components are
# because the documentation is still a bit fuzzy, and using GN build rules
# like package() incorrectly is very easy and leads to GN errors that are
# really hard to understand. This will also make the content of this file
# clearer for anyone wanting to understand how it works.
#
# In Fuchsia, a package is the unit of distribution, and a component is the
# unit of execution. More precisely:
#
#  - A package is an archive with a specific filesystem layout, e.g.:
#
#      - executables can go under bin/ or test/ (by convention).
#      - shared libraries the executable(s) depend on will go under lib/
#      - non-executable files used by the executables will go under data/
#      - the meta/ directory contains metadata describing the package's
#        content.
#      - each package can contain one or more components, and each one of
#        them has a corresponding manifest file under meta/<component>.cmx
#
#  - A component's manifest describes how said component is run, i.e.:
#
#      - which binary executable must be launched to start it.
#      - which specific sandbox features, devices and services it requires.
#
#  IMPORTANT: The format of component manifest file is going to change, which
#             is why the documentation at fuchsia.dev does not match the
#             descriptions below, which still correspond to the current format!
#
#   As an example, the manifest for a trivial unit-test would look like:
#
#     {
#       "program": { "binary": "bin/foo_unittest" },
#       "sandbox": {
#         "features": [ "isolated-temp" ]
#         "services": [ "fuchsia.logger.LogSink" ]
#       }
#     }
#
# Here the 'program' entry points to the actual executable.
# The 'sandbox' entry lists the "isolated-temp" feature (to ensure that /tmp
# exists when the program is run), and a service to ensure that logs can
# be sent to the syslog, instead of disappearing into the void.
#
# One can imagine that this manifest is stored as `meta/foo_component.cmx` in
# the `foo_package` package. In this case, one would invoke it with:
#
#     fx shell run fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/foo_package#meta/foo_component.cmx
#
# However, most of the time, the package and component will have the same name
# and the following will be equivalent (if there is no ambiguity):
#
#     fx shell run foo_package
#     # Same as using fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/foo_package#meta/foo_package.cmx
#
# Note that components are started in the environment of their caller. I.e.
# foo_unittest will be connecting to the fuchsia.logger.LogSink service
# running inside the shell process when started with "fx shell run ...".
#
# Simple executable components were just described above, but Fuchsia also
# defines a different component type: a "test component". The difference
# between a regular and test component are the following:
#
#  - Binaries are placed under test/ instead of bin/ (again, by convention).
#
#  - Test components can be launched with the "run" shell command, in which
#    case they are launched like regular executables, i.e. they inherit the
#    environment of their caller (which will normally be the shell).
#
#  - Test components can also be launched with the "runtests --names <name>" shell
#    command. Compared to "run", the latter will first create a new hermetic
#    Fuchsia process to run the test program inside, decoupled from the
#    caller.
#
#    Incidentally, this is what "fx test <component>" does too, after
#    eventually rebuilding the package then updating it on the target device.
#
#  - By default, said hermetic process environment is very limited, but the
#    test component's manifest can also specify services to inject into the
#    process before running it.
#
#    This is done by adding an entry under the "facets" dictionary in the
#    manifest, for example, for a test that uses Vulkan would have something
#    like the following:
#
#    {
#        "facets": {
#            "fuchsia.test": {
#                "system-services": [
#                    "fuchsia.sysmem.Allocator",
#                    "fuchsia.vulkan.loader.Loader"
#                ]
#            }
#        },
#        "program": { "binary": "test/foo_vulkan_test" },
#        "sandbox": {
#            "features": [
#              "vulkan"
#            ],
#            "services": [
#                "fuchsia.sysmem.Allocator",
#                "fuchsia.vulkan.loader.Loader",
#            ]
#        }
#    }
#
# Notice how the same services appear twice in the manifest above.
# But the "system-services" part is only used by "runtests", and ignored
# when the test is launched with "run".
#

# Generate a Fuchsia package that contains a single component.
# The binary executable target must be defined before calling this rule.
# This will generate the component manifest automatically.
#
# Accept all variables from the GN executable() rule, as well as:
# Variables:
#    needs_vulkan (optional)
#      [boolean] Set to true if Vulkan is required to run the component.
#
#    test_package (optional)
#      [boolean] Set to true to turn this into a test package that can
#      run with 'fx test' or 'fx shell runtests'. Will force |testonly|
#      to be true.
#
#    test_environments (optional)
#      [list of strings] A list of test environments. Requires |test_package|
#      to be true. Used to run the test in the right environment on the
#      continuous integration bots.
