// Agents that have been 'started' receive all inbound questions and resource records via their
// |ReceiveQuestion| and |ReceiveResource| methods. When the agent host receives an inbound
// message, it calls those methods for each question and resource in the message. When that's
// done, the host calls |EndOfMessage| on each agent.
//
// Agents may call any of the protected 'Send' methods (|SendQuestion|, |SendResource| and
// |SendAddresses|) at any time. The host accumulates the questions and resources and sends
// them in messages. Typically, agents don't have to worry about sending messages. Messages
// are sent for accumulated questions and resources:
//
// 1) after |Start| is called on any agent,
// 2) after an inbound message is processed and all agents have gotten their |EndOfMessage| calls,
// 3) after an agent is removed (in case it wants to say goodbye),
// 4) after the completion of any task posted using |PostTaskForTime|.
//
// If an agent wants a message sent asynchronously with respect to agent start, inbound message
// arrival, agent removal and posted tasks, the agent should call |FlushSentItems|. Calling
// |FlushSentItems| synchronously with those operations isn't harmful.
