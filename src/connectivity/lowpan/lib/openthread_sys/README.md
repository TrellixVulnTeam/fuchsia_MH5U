Unsafe OpenThread Bindings for Rust
===================================

This crate contains the unsafe Rust FFI bindings for the OpenThread API.
If you want to use the OpenThread API from rust, you will likely want to
use the safe OpenThread crate, which provides a type-safe wrapper around this
API.

The script `platgen.sh` will regenerate the bindings.
