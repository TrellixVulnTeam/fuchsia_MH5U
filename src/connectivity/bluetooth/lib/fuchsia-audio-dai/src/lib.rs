/*! Fuchsia DAI Library

This library can be used to communicate with a Digital Audio Interface device as defined by
https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/drivers/driver_architectures/audio_drivers/audio_dai
using the driver node directly.

Components using the library will need to have access to the dai class of devices in their component
 manifest.
