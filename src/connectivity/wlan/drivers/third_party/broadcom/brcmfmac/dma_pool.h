// This class manages a set of memory buffers that may be mapped for CPU access and/or passed to a
// device for DMA access.  A lease on a memory buffer is held using a Buffer instance, which holds
// that ownership in a RAII fashion.  Buffer instances can then be mapped (for CPU access) or pinned
// (for DMA access).  When the Buffer is destroyed, the underlying buffer is returned to the pool.
//
// The intended usage pattern for CPU to device transfers:
//
// * CPU leases a buffer with DmaPool::Allocate(), which returns a Buffer.
// * CPU maps the buffer for writing with Buffer::MapWrite().
// * CPU pins the buffer for DMA access with Buffer::Pin().
// * CPU sends the DMA command using the DMA address of the buffer.
//   * At this point, if the CPU wishes to stop tracking the buffer, it can release it with
//     Buffer::Release().
//   * After the DMA device finishes using the buffer in this case, the CPU then re-acquires the
//     buffer with DmaPool::Acquire().
// * CPU returns the buffer to the DmaPool using Buffer::Reset(), or by destroying the Buffer
//   instance.
//
// For device to CPU transfers:
//
// * CPU leases a buffer with DmaPool::Alocate(), which returns a Buffer.
// * CPU pins the buffer for DMA access with Buffer::Pin().
// * CPU sends the DMA command using the DMA address of the buffer.
//   * At this point, if the CPU wishes to stop tracking the buffer, it can release it with
//     Buffer::Release().
//   * After the DMA device finishes using the buffer in this case, the CPU then re-acquires the
//     buffer with DmaPool::Acquire().
// * CPU maps the buffer for reading with Buffer::MapRead().
// * CPU returns the buffer to the DmaPool using Buffer::Reset(), or by destroying the Buffer
//   instance.
