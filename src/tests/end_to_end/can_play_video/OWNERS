# End-to-end tests can be written for different parts of the Fuchsia stack and
# stored in this directory. When creating a new end-to-end test, add your own
# OWNERS file in your directory so we can tell who is responsible for those
# tests.
#
# People listed below often have to make changes to multiple end-to-end tests
# and can offer advice for your own test.
