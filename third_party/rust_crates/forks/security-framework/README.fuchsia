# What is this crate used for?

At the time of writing, TLS certificate retrieval on macOS.

# Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

It only works on macOS.

# What differs from upstream?

Files which do not comply with Fuchsia's license policy were removed. No code changes were made.

# Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

Comment out this crate's line in the `[patch.crates-io]` section of
`//third_party/rust_crates/Cargo.toml` before running the vendoring script, then move the contents
of `//third_party/rust_crates/vendor/security-framework` into this directory.

Care must be taken to only include files which comply with our license policy.

# Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
