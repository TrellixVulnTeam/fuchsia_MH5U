# What is this crate used for?

At time of writing it is used for a few utility calculations in graphics code.

# Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

No.

# What differs from upstream?

This is a very thin stub compared to libm on crates.io, and we link directly against our own libc
functions rather than having pure Rust implementations.

# Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

This should not be rolled from the upstream crate source until
https://github.com/rust-lang/libm/issues/215 is resolved, assuming the resolution leaves the
upstream source compatible with our license policy. File a bug in the `OSRB` component once the
issue is closed.

# Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
