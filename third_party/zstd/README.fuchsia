Description:
Zstandard is a fast compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios.

This directory has the Fuchsia build integration for zstd.  The src/
subdirectory gets the checkout of the zstd repository, which is mirrored
verbatim from the upstream (github) repository and pinned in the integration
manifest.  If there are any issues with the zstd build, they should be resolved
upstream or worked around with build-only changes in this directory.  The zstd
sources should not be touched so as not to fork the repository at all.
