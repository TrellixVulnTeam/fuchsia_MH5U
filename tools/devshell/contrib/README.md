# Contrib

This directory contains fx commands that are not officially supported.
They have been contributed by community members and are supported
by the community.

When you add a new tool, please be sure to edit the OWNERS file and add
`per-file` lines for the owners and `per-file-COMPONENT` lines for
bugs.fuchsia.dev components. These indicate the correct contact information for
your command and are used by `fx report-bug` users to file issues.

The main documentation for writing fx commands is given in `../README.md`.
