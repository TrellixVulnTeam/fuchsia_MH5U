### Generate CIPD files to download the current QEMU package.

## Usage: fx qemu-cipd-ensure
##
## This looks at the current jiri checkout to find the QEMU package version
## to use.  Then it generates CIPD files that you can copy over to any
## machine and use to get the QEMU package installed locally there.  This
## works even if build host where you run this script and the place you use
## the output are different OS or machine types.
##
## The files `qemu-cipd.ensure` and `qemu-cipd.versions` will be generated
## in the current build directory.  Comments in `qemu-cipd.ensure` explain
## how to use these files.  It should work on any machine connected to the
## Internet with no prior setup.
