### build a test package and run on target.

## This command is being deprecated in favor of `fx test`. Read more at:
##   https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/testing/running_tests_as_components#converting_from_run-test_or_run-host-tests
##
## usage: fx run-test-component [-t|--test <test_name>] [-d|--device <device>] PKG_TARGET
## Builds the specified test package (e.g., appmgr_integration_tests), copies it to the
## target, and executes it.
##
## PKG_TARGET is fully qualified or under fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/
##
## If using this command, please run 'fx build' again before paving your device
## because 'fx build updates' used by this script does not build images so it
## can leave paver in weird state.
## Arguments:
##   -t|--test    Test to run. If not specified, it will run all tests in PKG_TARGET.
##   -d|--device  Target device.
