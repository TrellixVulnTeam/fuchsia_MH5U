# Artifactory

Artifactory is a host tool which uploads build artifacts from the local build
directory to a cloud storage bucket in an organized layout. The artifacts which
are uploaded are determined by build API metadata, e.g. images.json, blobs.json,
binaries.json, etc.

The infrastructure invokes the tool after each build, so that the artifacts may
be accessed by downstream clients.

## Cloud storage layout

Artifacts specific to a build e.g. images are uploaded to a unique namespace
according to a unique `-namespace`. Artifacts which may be shared across builds,
e.g. blobs, debug binaries, etc. are uploaded to a shared namespace. The precise
layout is documented in [cmd/up.go](cmd/up.go).

## Deduplication

Artifacts which live in shared namespaces are not uploaded more than once. Thus
the number of files uploaded, and the runtime of the tool, go down depending on
the amount of deduplication across builds and/or repeat invocations.

## Signing

The tool can be instructed to sign artifacts prior to upload by providing a
ED25519 private key. See the `-pkey` flag in [cmd/up.go](cmd/up.go)
and the implementation in [sign.go](sign.go).
