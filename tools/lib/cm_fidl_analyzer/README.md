# `cm_fidl_annalyzer` library

This library contains common component manager linting analysis features
for component manifests. This provides a common location for static analysis
features for these manifests that can then be integrated into other tooling.

This library is still a work in progress, with its initial usage in the
SDK tool `//src/security/scrutiny`.
