# The Rust wisdom server binary

This directory contains the Rust wisdom server binary.  Detailed instructions
on how to build and run are in the [language-level README.md
file](../README.md).

Some useful instructions on how to set up a `BUILD.gn` file for building rust
binaries are here, in the [comments of the BUILD.gn file here](BUILD.gn).

General testing instructions for Rust code, upon which the instructions here
are based, is on the page [about Rust code
testing](/developmet/languages/rust/testing).
