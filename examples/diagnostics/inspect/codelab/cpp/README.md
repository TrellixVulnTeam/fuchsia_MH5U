# Inspect C++ Example

Reviewed on: 2020-01-10

This directory contains the example program for the Inspect C++ Codelab.

## Building

To add this project to your build, append `--with
//examples/diagnostics/inspect/codelab/cpp` to the `fx set` invocation.

## Running

The example program consists of a client program that starts the codelab
server and connects to it.  The codelab server implements a service called
"Reverser" that simply reverses strings passed to it.

Each part of the codelab has its own component, and the client program
can be configured to open a specific part.

To run Part 2 of the codelab and pass the strings "Hello" and "World"
to the service, run the following:
```
$ fx shell run inspect_cpp_codelab_client 2 Hello World
```

## Testing

Unit tests for the codelab are available in the `inspect_cpp_codelab_unittests`
package.

Integration tests are also available in the `inspect_cpp_codelab_integration_tests`
package.

```
$ fx run-test inspect_cpp_codelab_unittests
$ fx run-test inspect_cpp_codelab_integration_tests
```

## Source layout

- `client/` contains the source for `inspect_cpp_codelab_client`
- `fizzbuzz/` contains the source for `inspect_cpp_codelab_fizzbuzz`,
a service that the codelab server depends on to demonstrate service
dependencies.
- `part_#/`, where # is a number, contains the source for the respective
part of the codelab.
- `part_#/tests` contains the source for the integration tests.
