# FIDL examples

This directory contains snippets of FIDL that are used throughout the
Fuchsia documentation.

Generally, files in this directory are organized by the documentation file that
the snippets appear in. When changing FIDL here, ensure that any usages are
updated. You can find usages by grepping for the tag name within the
`[START ...]`/`[END ...]` tags.
