# Failed routing Example

This directory contains an example of failed [capability
routing][capability-routing] in [Component Framework][cf-intro] ([Components
v2][cfv2]).

## Building

If these components are not present in your build, they can be added by
appending `--with //examples` to your `fx set` command. For example:

```bash
$ fx set core.x64 --with //examples
$ fx build
```

(Disclaimer: if these build rules become out-of-date, please check the
[Build documentation](docs/development/workflows) and update this README!)

## Running

Use `ffx component create` to create the component instances inside a restricted
realm for development purposes:

```bash
$ ffx component create /core/ffx-laboratory:echo_realm fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/components-routing-failed-example#meta/echo_realm.cm
```

Start the client component instance by passing its moniker to
`ffx component start`:

```bash
$ ffx component start /core/ffx-laboratory:echo_realm/echo_client
```

To see component manager's log of the failed capability routing, run:

```bash
$ fx log
```
